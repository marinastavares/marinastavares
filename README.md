# console.log('Hello, github 🤟🏼!')

My name is Marina, I'm 23 years old living in Florianópolis and I'm a control and automation engineer grad student at UFSC ~~(hopefully I'll get my degree this year)~~. I've been working with ReactJS for 1 year and 6 months as a Software Engineer Intern at [Jungle Devs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jungledevs), and I can say that I'm really passionate with web development.

Here at my github you can find some content that I've done during my graduation and also some repos regarding some tutorials that I had followed (still trying to learn a bit of NodeJS as well).

 
 ## Repos that i'm really proud of
 
 - 🐰[salvador-da-pascoa-react](https://github.com/COVIDSolutionsCommunity/salvador-da-pascoa-react): It is a project done during the pandemic to help the to all confectioners, small businesses and entrepreneurs who earn extra income during easter season (in Brasil is really common to have a lot of people selling handmade chocolate eggs) and were having difficulties to advertise and sell their products because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this platform is cost free.

 - 🛣[la-da-rua-react](https://github.com/COVIDSolutionsCommunity/la-da-rua-react):  This is a marketplace, also cost free, aiming to help small businesses and entrepreneurs from Fortaleza, Ceará, to share your products during the COVID-19 pandemic.
