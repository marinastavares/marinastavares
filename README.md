My name is Marina, I'm 24 years old living in Florianópolis and I got a Bachelor degree on Control and Automation Engineer. I've been working with ReactJS for 2 year and 7 months as a Software Engineer at [Jungle Devs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jungledevs), and I can say that I'm really passionate with web development.
